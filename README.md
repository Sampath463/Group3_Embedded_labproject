Project Title: GPS-Based Direction Finder

Problem Statement: In this project, we aim to develop a navigation aid that directs a user from their current location to a pre-defined target point (minimum 200 meters away).
Using a GPS module, the device will continuously update the userâ€™s current coordinates and calculate the direction to the target location. 
The direction will be visually displayed using an LED ring, allowing the user to intuitively follow the path to the destination.
